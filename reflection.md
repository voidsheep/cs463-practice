## Reflection Document

### HTML

I did the first 3 exercises on my own, and used the solution video for the final one.
The excercises were all helpful in getting acclimated to HTML.
I was a bit overwhelmed with exercise 4 at first. I wasn't sure what order to start or
place things at first.
Another exercise leading up to 4 may've been helpful, but it was fine.

### Accessibility

I used the video because no instructions were included in the folder.
This was a pretty useful exercise.
I'm not sure if instructions were meant to be included?
Perhaps another exercise focusing on different sort's accessbility issues. I think this
one was pretty sufficient when paired with the homework though.

## CSS

I used the videos heavily for these exercises because there was a lot to understand about CSS.
This exercises were very helpful. I think the media query one was well explained.
There were many exercises, and I feel like I learned a lot.
